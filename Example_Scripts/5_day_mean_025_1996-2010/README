Experiment to run backwards for 25 years, sourcing the particles at 24 North and intergrating them backwards from Dec 2010 to
Jan 1996. The experiment used 5 day mean ORCA025-N401 data, and initialised particles in the last 30 data files, ie from July
to Dec 2010.

The quantitative experiment was run in the directory containing:
namelist
segrid
region_limits
sections.txt

The results folder contains the output of running this experiment, including the edited mod_criter.f90 files.
These files were edited and then Ariane reinstalled before running as described in the user manual found on the website.
mod_criter0 is set to only initite particles at a certian depth range
mod_criter1 is set to only integrate particles for the same fixed length of time

The qualitative folder has the namelist for calculating the trajectories of the particles that made it to the northern 
boundaries in the quantitative experiments. You create a subbin.txt file with the particles you with to initiate, and 
then change bin from 'nobin' to 'subbin' in the namelist file.
