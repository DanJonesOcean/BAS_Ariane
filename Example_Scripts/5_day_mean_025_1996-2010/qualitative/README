To run the qaulitative experiment you need a new directory containing these files

The subbset.txt file is generated by the ariane-x.x.x/examples/shell_scripts/subset_select_sections.sh file.

I ran the command "./subset_select_sections.sh 2 3 5" to select the particles that reached the boundaries 2, 3, 5, as given
in the stats.txt file.

You also need a symbolic link to the netcdf quantitative output

ln -s ../ariane_positions_quantitative.nc ariane_initials.nc

So you can think of the output of this experiment, as the trajectories of theparticles that left the Northern regions 
in 1996, and ended up at the 24N detection site in the last 6 months of 2010
