The mesh grid files stored in the NEMO groupspace also have to be edited for Ariane to be able to read it.
They can be found in directories similar to /group_workspaces/jasmin2/nemo/vol1/ORCA025-N401/domain which contains :
		mesh_hgr.nc
		mesh_zgr.nc
		mask.nc

You can copy these to your home directory and to combine them into a complete mesh_hgr.nc, that Ariane can read, you
run the commands: 

cp mesh_hgr.nc mesh_hgr.nc_orig
ncks -A -v e3t mesh_zgr.nc mesh_hgr.nc
ncks -A -v gdepw_0 mesh_zgr.nc mesh_hgr.nc
ncks -A -v tmask mask.nc mesh_hgr.nc

These are given in the Ariane Namelist Document on the Ariane website (http://stockage.univ-brest.fr/~grima/Ariane/doc.html).

You have to be careful though because the first variable e3t is called e3t_0 in ORCA0083-N006 data, I am not sure what it is
in the other folders, but make sure it is a 4 dimensional double not a 2 dimensional one. These names are also different to 
the ones in the Ariane Namelist Document. The vairable names are generally inconsistent.

Use 'ncdump -h mesh_zgr.nc' to check

        i.e. for ORCA025-N401                     i.e. for ORCA0083-N006
        double e3t(t, z, y, x) ;                  double e3t_0(t, z, y, x) ;      
        		e3t:_FillValue = 0. ;                 		e3t_0:_FillValue = 0. ;
        double e3t_0(t, z) ;                      double e3t_1d(t, z) ;
		        e3t_0:_FillValue = 0. ;                   e3t_1d:_FillValue = 0. ;
