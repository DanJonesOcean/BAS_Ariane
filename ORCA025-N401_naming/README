Ariane is very particular about the naming of the data files that reads in.
These scripts should create symbolic links in a directory of your choice ($OUTDIR) pointing to the data in the NEMO groupspace on Jasmin with a nameing format that Ariane can handle with the following formats.

In the Ariane namelist file:

c_dir_xx = $OUTDIR,
c_prefix_xx = 'ORCA025-N401_{a}_{b}_',   where a = {d,m,y} and b = {U,V,W,T}
c_suffix_xx ='.nc',

  i.e. for 5 day mean data
        &ZONALCRT 
        c_dir_zo = '/home/users/user_name/links_folder/',
        c_prefix_zo = 'ORCA025-N401_d_U_', 
        c_suffix_zo ='.nc',
        
        &MERIDCRT
        c_dir_me = '/home/users/user_name/links_folder/',
        c_prefix_me = 'ORCA025-N401_d_V_', 
        c_suffix_me ='.nc',
        
        etc.

To correctly set ind0 and indn, the command 'ls -rtl $OUTDIR' will show you which index number corresponds to which data file, an example is given in the scripts

The example namelist is for a backwards running quantitative experiment with 5 day mean data. 
The attibutes that these scripts will set are given in the &ZONALCRT, &MERIDCRT, &VERTICRT, &TEMPERAT, and &SALINITY sections, as described above
