To install Ariane in your Jasmin home directory
Upload the ariane-x.x.x folder into your home directory, replace 'user_name' with your Jasmin username and run these 
bash commands:

export NETCDF_INC=/usr/include
export NETCDF_LIB=/usr/lib64
./configure --prefix=/home/users/user_name
make && make check 
make install

can check it has correctly installed with 'which ariane', a correct install returning '~/bin/ariane'

The 'make uninstall' command will cleanly uninstall the instalation if things go wrong.

There are other builds of Ariane on Jasmin if you want to use them, however they will potentially have their own 
methods of implimenting the criteria scripts (mod_criter0.f90 etc) that differ from the user manual on the Ariane 
website (http://stockage.univ-brest.fr/~grima/Ariane/doc.html), which requires you to edit some fortran files and 
reinstall Ariane.
